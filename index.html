								<h2>About Martin Galvan</h2>
								<p>

									I've been in the bail bond business for 8 years, and got my start working for Shawn Blanton at Papa's Bail Bonds. He gave me the opportunity to get into the Bail Bonds business in 2015. I was one of the first Hispanic bail bondsman in the area, and I really feel like I've made a difference in the big Hispanic community we have in Hamblen County. We are one of the few companies that have bilingual agents on standby for the people that only speak Spanish. I enjoy helping people and working with them because I know it's hard to see a loved one in jail if the people didn't have all the money.</p>
									
									<p>I've had a few bumps in my journey, but God blessed me with my own company, which I am thankful for every day. I try to get involved with our community as much as possible. I was born in California but moved to Morristown, TN when I was 7 years old, so to me, Morristown is my home. I grew up here, and I want to see our community progress. In addition to running the business, I help run and coach the Jr. Trojans, a football league in which all 5 of my boys have played in.</p>
									
									<p>I want to thank my workers because without them, I wouldn't be where I am now. I have an awesome team. I also want to thank God, my family, and my community for giving me the chance to have a successful business.
									</p>
